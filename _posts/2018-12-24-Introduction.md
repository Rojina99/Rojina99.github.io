This has long been overdue. I always wanted to share my experiences I have gained in last three years.
I thought this might be helpful for anybody who is willing to step into the field of Machine Learning.

I had so many obstacles when I started; as lack of enough materials in the internet, lack of understanding of where to start for preparing a Machine Learning project.
The field has grown immensely from the time I have started. But I know there are still many beginners who want to step into the this field but are hesitating due to lack of proper understanding of the field.
And I think this might be helpful.

I will start this tutorial from the very beginning point where I had started back then, for my 4th year Major Project in Engineering. I hope that this might be useful for someone who is fledging in this field.
