We have a rule in our college that we cannot choose the topics or algorithms that our senior had done in previous year. Since, we were willing to do a project related to prediction of disease. Our senoirs had done a project on pneumonia detection using Bayesian Network. So, we had no any algorithm of choice rather than Artificial Neural Network; That's what we thought at that time.

Firstly, lets start with Artificial Neural Network which we have researched at our very first month of project. Artificial Neural Networks simply the structure used to calculate output based on input, hidden layer followed by activation functions to produce desired result.

Lets, now discuss about each aspect of neural network in detail:
ANN consists of neurons, weights, biases, layers.

  1. Neurons consits of values calculated using activation function and biases(We will discuss more about this in later post)
  2. Weights are the values between neurons of one layer to another.
  3. ANN consists of minimum three layer input layer, hidden layer and output layer. If a network consists of only one          hidden layer it is also referred as one layer network.
