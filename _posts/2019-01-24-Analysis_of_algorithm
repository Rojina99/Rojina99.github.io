Computer Science progressing in the path of AI. With the invent of neural networks, deep learning has also been possible.But we are still not able to attend the result as we expect. The researchers are continuously working on preparing algorithms that can replicate human brain working mechanism.Why is it so that we are still note able to attend the results we expect like in the case of CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) , the network is not able to give generalize results and also not able to classify the image with high accuracy where there are complex image combined.

It might be because we are not preparing algorithms as per the working mechanism of human brain.There are mainly three aspect that human brain considers and we are highly missing in Deep Neural Network. The human brain has not been prepared in small coarse of time but have taken years of evolution to attend a network structure in brain which can solve very complex task with minimum input provided.The human has DNA's that they acquired from their parents which they attend from their parents and so on.It is that we are not able to use the past networks structure and their outcomes in our current algorithms as human brain does.The other aspect is that we are not considering how a human brain learns, how a child learns from environment.A child at the time of birth can only perceive very small amount of data which the child uses in its life like crying, being happy and optimizing those procedures again and again which we called is been inbuilt to subconscious human brain.Then a little after that a child will be able to perceive a little more information and then optimize it.It also then generalizes those information rather than just perceiving specific set of data , it also perceives a lot more data.This process of optimization and generalization continues throughout the lifetime of human.We are not able to find a way for this generalization in existing algorithms.The other important aspect is we are only considering a specific portion of senses to input data to neural network.But we miss that the human brain just not only take image inputs or sound inputs discretely and process them discretely but does this at once.We cannot imagine a person with only one senses can survive very well. This is due to the limitation of data input the person can survive with.Similarly, the networks cannot do very well with only one aspect of data inputted at once to learn.

There are some of the algorithms being introduced like One Shot Learning which learns from the pre-trained network.This method can be resembled with the transfer of genes from parents to child.Recently in the Robot Sophia has been seen to take more than one forms of input like image, speech like human does to make decisions.But this procedures are not as much efficient and developed as the human brain process.This is very exciting time for AI researchers and Programmers.We hope to see a lot more coming on the way with this field.
